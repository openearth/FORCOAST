Welcome to the FORCOAST Platform.

The EU-funded project FORCOAST is developing, testing and demonstrating, in operational mode, novel Copernicus-based downstream information services that will incorporate Copernicus Marine, Land and Climate Services Products, local monitoring data and advanced modelling in the service. The services integrate Copernicus Earth Observation Products with local models and other diverse data sources (local, regional or global) across the different market segments.
