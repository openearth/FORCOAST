* Select a start date for the simulation.
* Specify the pollution discharge location, by placing the marker on the central map.
* Draw a rectangle in the map where the area you want to evauluate is (e.g. farm location) ny using the drwaing tool in the top left part of the map.
* Click 'RUN' to start the service.
* Once the computation is finished, click 'SHOW RESULTS' to access the information bulletin with the results of your simulation.
