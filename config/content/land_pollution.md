To run the Land Pollution service, go through the following steps:

* Select a start date for the simulation.
* Specify the pollution discharge location, by placing the marker on any location on water and within the domain marked purple on the map.
* Draw a rectangle in the map where the area you want to evauluate is (e.g. farm location) by using the drawing tool in the top left part of the map. This should be done on water and within the domain marked by the purple bounding box on the map.
* Click 'RUN' to start the service.
* Once the computation is finished, click 'SHOW RESULTS' to access the information bulletin with the results of your simulation.
