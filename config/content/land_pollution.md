To run the Land Pollution service, go through the following steps:  

**1)** Select a start date for the simulation  
**2)** Specify the pollution discharge location, by
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placing the marker on any location on water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and within the domain marked purple on the map  
**3)** Draw a rectangle in the map where the area you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want to evauluate is (e.g. farm location) by 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using the drawing tool located in the top right
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of the map. This should be done on water
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and within the domain marked by the purple
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bounding box on the map  
**4)** Click 'RUN' to start the service  
**5)** Once the computation is finished, click 'SHOW
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESULTS' to access the information bulletin with
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the results of your simulation  

Each simulations takes <u>30 minutes</u> indicatively
