To run the Site Prospection service, go through the following steps:  

1 "Basic parameters": enter the year and months of interest, as well as salinity and temperature thresholds  
2 "Optional parameters": extra variables in case you can provide extra information (the default values are tuned for flat oysters)  
3 "Area": specify your area of interest using the polygon tool in the lower right of the map. This should be done within the area marked by the purple bounding box
