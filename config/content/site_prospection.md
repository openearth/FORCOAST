To run the Site Prospection service, go through the following steps:

* "Basic parameters": enter the year and months of interest, as well as salinity and temperature thresholds.
* "Optional parameters": extra variables in case you can provide extra information (the default values are tuned for flat oysters).
* "Area": specify your area of interest using the tool in the top left of the map.
