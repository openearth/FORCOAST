This service provides a measure of the probability for farming sites to be affected by harmfull land discharge. A source and farming location  must be selected and a simulation start date must be given. The pollutants dispersion is forecasted for up to 10 days. The result is a bulletin showing the pollutants track, details on pollutants in the selected farming location and a risk indication for the farm (see example bulletin).
