This service uses a backtracking simulation to find the potential source of contaminants. A location is chosen where the contaminants are present. The duration of the backtracking simulation and the start time of the simulation must also be set. A bulletin will be produced highlighting areas with a probability of it being the contaminants source (see example bulletin).
