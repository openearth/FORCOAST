To run the Contaminant Source Retrieval service, go through the following steps:

* Select a start date for the simulation.
* Specify your location of interest, where contaminants are present, by placing the marker on the central map. This should be done on water and within the domain marked by the purple bounding box on the map.
* Enter how long you want the simulation to trace back the contaminants.
* Click 'RUN' to start the service.
* Once the computation is finished, click 'SHOW RESULTS' to access the information bulletin with the results of your simulation.
