To run the Assistance for Spat Capture service module go through the following steps:  

1 Select a method to be used: 'Temperature threshold' or 'Cumulative temperature'  
2 The temperature threshold method requires a temperature threshold for egg/larvae release (spawning/swarming)  
3 The cumulative temperature method requires to give a threshold for gonade development and a threshold of cumulative temperature above which eggs/larvae are released. The cumulative temperature value is the sum of water temperatures since the beginning of the year.  
4 Select the pelagic larval duration. This is time it will take for the spats to drift to the farming location  
5 Select the duration of the spawning/release period

Each simulations takes 1-2 minutes indicatively
