To run the Assistance for Spat Capture service module go through the following steps:  

1 Select a method to be used: 'Temperature treshold' or 'Cumulative temperature'  
2 The temperature treshold method requires a temperature treshold for spat spawning  
3 The cumulative temperature method requires to give a treshold for gonade development and a treshold of cumulative temperature. The cumulative temperature value is the sum of water temperatures since the beginning of the year.  
4 Select the palegic larval duration. This is time it will take for the spats to drift to the farming location  
5 Select the duration of the spawning period of the spats
